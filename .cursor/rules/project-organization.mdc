# How we organize components and files

## UI Components from Shadcn/ui

- Will be stored in app/components/ui

## Custom components we create

- Will be stored in app/components/<name of component>

Ex. We want to create a custom profile-form.tsx component for the profile page.tsx

- This is stored in app/components/profile/

## actions

- All actions will be stored in app/actions/

## Naming conventions

- We will use kebab-case for all naming conventions. 

## Icons

- We will use Lucide icons for all UI components unless they do not have a satisfactory icon.
